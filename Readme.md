# Automated Resume Ranking System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered resume ranking system that evaluates CVs against job descriptions. By incorporating AIOPS, MLOps, and LLMops principles, the system ensures scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Use Case

- **Automated Resume Ranking System**: Effectively evaluates resumes based on their relevance to job descriptions using advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models.

## Requirements

### NLP Techniques
- Utilize advanced NLP methods such as:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Text Classification
  - Semantic Similarity

### Machine Learning Models
- Train and deploy models such as:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Deep Learning

### AIOPS
- Implement AI-driven operations to monitor system performance, detect anomalies, and proactively address issues.

### MLOps
- Establish MLOps pipelines for efficient model development, training, deployment, and management.

### LLMops
- Explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for:
  - Generating personalized feedback
  - Enhancing semantic understanding

## Deliverables
- A well-defined machine learning model for resume ranking.
- An AIOPS framework for monitoring and optimizing system performance.
- MLOps pipelines for efficient model development and deployment.
- A report detailing the system's architecture, evaluation metrics, and results.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Accuracy**: The system should accurately rank resumes based on relevance to job descriptions.
- **Scalability**: The system should efficiently handle large volumes of resumes and job descriptions.
- **Explainability**: The system should provide insights into the reasons for its rankings to facilitate human review.
  
### Additional Points (Good to Have)
- **AIOPS**: An effective AIOPS framework that monitors and optimizes performance (bonus points).
- **MLOPS**: Streamlined model development and deployment process (bonus points).
- **LLMOPS**: Demonstrated added value and enhanced capabilities through LLM integration (bonus points).

## Sample Input
- Upload Job Description (JD) and multiple CVs.
